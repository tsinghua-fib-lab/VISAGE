In this paper, we propose the automatic detection and computation of the coordinates of recurring stationary objects of interest using street view imagery. Our processing pipeline relies on two fully convolutional neural networks: the first segments objects in the images, while the second estimates their distance from the camera. To geolocate all the detected objects coherently we propose a novel custom Markov random field model to estimate the objects’ geolocation. The novelty of the resulting pipeline is the combined use of monocular depth estimation and triangulation to enable automatic mapping of complex scenes with the simultaneous presence of multiple, visually similar objects of interest. We validate experimentally the effectiveness of our approach on two object classes: traffic lights and telegraph poles. The experiments report high object recall...",

Our approach unfolds in two steps. First, areas of vegetation are detected within street-level imagery using a state-of-the-art deep neural network model. Second, information is combined from several images to derive an aggregated indicator at the area level using a hierarchical multilevel model. The comparative performance of our proposed approach is demonstrated against a widely used image segmentation technique based on a pre-labelled dataset. The approach is deployed to a real-world scenario for the city of Cardiff, Wales, using Google Street View imagery. Based on more than 200,000 street-level images, an urban tree street-level indicator is derived to measure the spatial distribution of tree cover, accounting for the presence of obstructing objects...",

Existing works relied on either inter- or intra-region connectivities to generate neighborhood representations but failed to fully utilize the informative yet heterogeneous data within neighborhoods. In this work, we propose Urban2Vec, an unsupervised multi-modal framework which incorporates both street view imagery and point-of-interest (POI) data to learn neighborhood embeddings. Specifically, we use a convolutional neural network to extract visual features from street view images while preserving geospatial similarity. Furthermore, we model each POI as a bag-of-words containing its category, rating, and review information. Analog to document embedding in natural language processing, we establish the semantic similarity between neighborhood (“document”) and the words from its surrounding POIs in the vector space. By jointly encoding visual, textual, and geospatial information into the neighborhood representation, Urban2Vec can achieve performances better than baseline models and comparable to fully-supervised...",

Social media networks meanwhile have been recognized not only to create new communities in neighborhoods, but are also associated with gentrification. What relation then does gentrification and social media networks have to urban communities? To explore this question, this study uses social media networks found on Twitter to identify communities in Washington, DC. With space-time analysis of 821,095 geo-tagged tweets generated by 77,528 users captured from 15 October 2015 to 18 July 2016, we create a location-based interaction measure of tweets which overlays the social networks of the comprising users based on their followers and followees. We identify gentrifying neighborhoods with the 2000 Census and the 2010–2014 American Community Survey at the block group level. We then compare the density of location-based interactions between gentrifying and nongentrifying neighborhoods....",

In the absence of reliable data, Remote Sensing (RS)-based approaches, particularly the Deep Learning (DL) methods, have gained recognition and high accuracies for slum mapping. However, using RS alone has its limitation in complex urban environments. Previous studies showed the added value of combining ground-level information with RS. Therefore, this research aims to integrate Remote Sensing Imagery (RSI) and Street View Images (SVI) for slum mapping. Jakarta city is the study area representing the challenge of distinguishing between slum and non-slum kampungs, and these kampungs accommodate approximately 60% of the population of Jakarta. This research compares the mapping results obtained by four DL networks: FCN-DK6 used only RSI, a VGG16 used only SVI, and two networks combined RSI and SVI (FCN-DK6-i and Modified FCN-DK6). Further, the Modified FCN-DK6 network was explored by integrating SVI at each convolutional layer,...",

Google Street View is a technology implemented in several Google services/applications (e.g. Google Maps, Google Earth) which provides the user, interested in viewing a particular location on the map, with panoramic images (represented in equi-rectangular projection) at street level. Generally, consecutive panoramas are acquired with an average distance of 5–10 m and can be compared to a traditional photogrammetric strip and, thus, processed to reconstruct portion of city at nearly zero cost. Most of the photogrammetric software packages available today implement spherical camera models and can directly process images in equi-rectangular projection. Although many authors provided in the past relevant works that involved the use of Google Street View imagery, mainly for 3D city model reconstruction, very few references can be found about the actual accuracy that can be obtained with such data.

Therefore, realizing an automatic method for georeferencing NTL imagery is preferable. In this article, such an automatic processing chain for the georeferencing of NTL imagery is presented. The novel approach works by simulating reference NTL images from vector-based street network maps and finding tie points between these references and the NTL imagery. To test this approach, here, publicly available open street maps are used. The tie points identified in the reference and NTL imagery are then used for rectification and thereby for...",

This paper investigates the potential of a spatial accessibility index to provide evidence for making location/planning decisions that benefit the largest number of residents.

Here, I use a variation on standard smoothing techniques that allows the smoothing function to vary based on a second variable of interest, in this case, the location of major roads, railroads, and nonresidential land use. Using Philadelphia as a case study due to access to detailed land-use data, I show that barriers do not affect observed values of city-level racial and ethnic dissimilarity. Visualizing the impact of barriers on local neighborhoods, however, shows that...",

Leveraging natural language as a universal knowledge representation, OmDet accumulates “visual vocabularies” from diverse datasets, unifying the task as a language‐conditioned detection framework. The multimodal detection network (MDN) overcomes the challenges of multi‐dataset joint training and generalizes to numerous training datasets without manual label taxonomy merging. The authors demonstrate superior performance of OmDet over strong baselines in object detection in the wild, open‐vocabulary detection, and phrase grounding, achieving state‐of‐the‐art results.

In Montréal, Canada, 28 residents participated in semi-directed interviews and image evaluations, supported by the analysis of approximately 45,000 street-view images from Mapillary. The approach produced visual analytics, such as heatmaps, to correlate subjective user ratings with physical attributes like sidewalk, maintenance, greenery, and seating. Findings reveal variations in perceptions of inclusivity and accessibility across demographic groups, demonstrating that incorporating diverse user feedback can enhance machine learning models through careful data-labeling and co-production strategies.

In this paper, we address these deficiencies with a multi-faceted approach towards understanding spatial reasoning. Informed by the diverse and multi-dimensional nature of human spatial reasoning abilities, we present a detailed analysis that first delineates the core elements of spatial reasoning: spatial relations, orientation and navigation, mental rotation, and spatial visualization, and then assesses the performance of these models in both synthetic and real-world images, bridging controlled and naturalistic contexts.

By examining over 100 research papers, we provide the first systematic analysis dedicated to 3D object detection with vision-language models. We begin by outlining the unique challenges of 3D object detection with vision-language models, emphasizing differences from 2D detection in spatial reasoning and data complexity. Traditional approaches using point clouds and voxel grids are compared to modern vision-language frameworks like CLIP and 3D LLMs, which enable open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot generalization. We review key architectures, pretraining strategies, and prompt engineering methods that align textual and 3D features for effective 3D object detection with vision-language models. Visualization examples and evaluation benchmarks are discussed to illustrate performance and behavior. Finally, we highlight current challenges, such as limited 3D-language datasets and computational demands,...",

Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation. This raises a critical question: Can machines now \"see\" like citizens and infer informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications.

Leveraging the powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing hateful textual and/or visual components.

However, the substantial computational overhead associated with LVLMs presents a new challenge. The primary source of this computational cost arises from processing hundreds of image tokens. Therefore, an effective strategy to mitigate such overhead is to reduce the number of image tokens, a process known as image token pruning. Previous studies on image token pruning for LVLMs have primarily focused on high level visual understanding tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning. In contrast, guiding vision foundation models to generate accurate visual masks based on textual queries demands precise semantic and spatial reasoning capabilities. Consequently, pruning methods must carefully control individual image tokens throughout the LVLM reasoning process.

Using a suite of tasks targeting these abilities, we evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o. Our analysis reveals distinct cognitive profiles: while advanced models approach ceiling performance on some tasks (e.g. category identification), a significant gap persists, particularly in tasks requiring spatial understanding or selective attention. Investigating the source of these failures and potential methods for improvement, we employ a vision-text decoupling analysis, finding that models struggling with direct visual reasoning show marked improvement when reasoning over their own generated text captions.

Using multi-temporal SVI and UAV Imagery from the Koto Panjang cliff in Indonesia, we quantify rockfall volume changes over seven years and assess associated geohazards. The results reveal a total rockfall retreat of 5270 m3, with an average annual rate of 7.53 m3/year. Structural analysis identified six major discontinuity sets and confirmed inherent instability within the rock mass. Kinematic simulations using SVI and UAV-derived data further assessed rockfall trajectories and potential impact zones. Results indicate that 40% of simulated rockfall deposits accumulated near existing roads, with significant differences in distribution based on scree slope angles.

This study focuses on the growth of road networks in volunteered street view imagery (VSVI) data, using data from the Mapillary platform in Tokyo as a case study. The results demonstrate that VSVI data extends outward from the city center and is governed by two fundamental spatial processes, densification and exploration, as observed for OpenStreetMap in previous studies. Among these, densification becomes more dominant as dataset grows, rising from 76.8% to 91.4% of total contributions. Furthermore, bivariate regression analyses indicated relationships between the number of image contributions and road coverage, as well as the growth rate of road networks for various road types. Specifically, the growth in coverage for National Expressways follows a logarithmic model, whereas other road types are better represented by linear models with higher-grade roads exhibiting greater growth rates. This study represents the first attempt to explore the links between the number of contributions and spatial...",

To bridge this methodological gap, this study presents an innovative approach combining advanced deep learning techniques with time-series street view imagery (SVI) analysis to systematically quantify spatio-temporal variations in the perceived environmental quality of pedestrian-oriented streets. It further addresses two central questions: how perceived environmental quality varies spatially across sections of a pedestrian-oriented street and how these perceptions fluctuate temporally throughout the day.

Unfortunately, recent observations have highlighted considerable inconsistencies in the mapping process. These inconsistencies can be attributed to various factors, including variations in the expertise of surveyors and the intricacies of the indicators employed to characterize slum conditions. Consequently, reliable data is lacking, which poses a significant barrier to effective monitoring of slum upgrading programs. Remote sensing (RS)-based approaches, particularly those employing deep learning (DL) techniques, have emerged as a highly effective and accurate method for identifying slum areas. However, the reliance on RS alone is likely to encounter challenges in complex urban environments.

It reflects spatio-temporal variability and generates diverse, plausible, and novel mobility patterns consistent with the built environment. Beyond standard validation, MobilityGen yields insights not attainable with earlier models, including how access to urban space varies across travel modes and how co-presence dynamics shape social exposure and segregation.

      "Abstract150w": "Most existing social robot navigation techniques either leverage hand-crafted rules or human demonstrations to connect robot perception to socially compliant actions. However, there remains a significant gap in effectively translating perception into socially compliant actions, much like how human reasoning naturally occurs in dynamic environments. Considering the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose using language to bridge the gap in human-like reasoning between perception and socially aware robot actions. We create a vision-language dataset, Social robot Navigation via Explainable Interactions (SNEI), featuring 40K human-annotated Visual Question Answers (VQAs) based on 2K human-robot social interactions in unstructured, crowded public spaces, spanning perception, prediction, chain-of-thought reasoning, action, and explanation. We fine-tune a VLM, Social-LLaVA, using SNEI to demonstrate the practical application of our dataset. Social-LLaVA outperforms state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Gemini, based on the average of fifteen different human-judge scores across 50 VQA. Deployed onboard a mobile robot, Social-LLaVA...",

To fill the knowledge gap about particulate pollution and its adverse health effects in rural India for well-informed region-specific policy interventions, we present new insights on the rural pollution of India in terms of PM(2.5). Here, we analyse PM(2.5) pollution and its associated health burden in rural India using satellite and reanalyses data for the period 2000-2019. We observe a gradual and consistent rise of atmospheric pollution in rural areas of India. The highest PM(2.5) levels are observed in Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) during winter and post-monsoon seasons (107.0 +/- 17.0 and 91.0 +/- 21.7 mug/m(3), respectively). A dipole reversal in seasonal trends between winter and post-monsoon seasons is found for black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) in the rural IGP.

In this work, we introduce a manually annotated benchmark, Q-Spatial Bench, with 271 questions across five categories designed for quantitative spatial reasoning and systematically investigate the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs on this task. Our analysis reveals that reasoning about distances between objects is particularly challenging for SoTA VLMs; however, some VLMs significantly outperform others, with an over 40-point gap between the two best performing models. We also make the surprising observation that the success rate of the top-performing VLM increases by 19 points when a reasoning path using a reference object emerges naturally in the response. Inspired by this observation, we develop a zero-shot prompting technique, SpatialPrompt, that encourages VLMs to answer quantitative spatial questions using reference objects as visual cues....",

However, the root causes of deteriorating mental health remain poorly understood, with existing literature predominantly concentrating on socioeconomic conditions and psychological factors. This study uses multi-linear and geographically weighted regressions (GWR) to examine the associations between built and natural environmental attributes and the prevalence of depression in US counties. The findings reveal that job sprawl and land mixed use are highly correlated with a lower risk of depression. Additionally, the presence of green spaces, especially in urban area, is associated with improved mental health. Conversely, higher concentrations of air pollutants, such as PM(2.5) and CO, along with increased precipitation, are linked to elevated depression rates. When considering spatial correlation through GWR, the impact of population density and social capital on mental health displays substantial spatial heterogeneity.

As urban spaces and social relations grow more complex, residents in metropolitan areas experience varying levels of social segregation. If left unaddressed, this could lead to increased crime rates, heightened social tensions, and other serious issues. Effectively quantifying and analyzing the structures within urban spaces and resident interactions is crucial for addressing segregation. Previous studies have mainly focused on surface-level indicators of urban segregation, lacking comprehensive analyses of urban structure and mobility. This limitation fails to capture the full complexity of segregation. To address this gap, we propose a framework named Motif-Enhanced Graph Prototype Learning (MotifGPL),which consists of three key modules: prototype-based graph structure extraction, motif distribution discovery, and urban graph structure reconstruction. Specifically, we use graph structure prototype learning to extract key prototypes from both the urban spatial graph and the origin-destination graph,...",

The literature has traditionally focused on residential segregation, examining how individuals' residential locations are distributed differently across neighborhoods based on various social attributes, e.g., race, ethnicity, and income. However, this approach overlooks the complexity of spatial segregation in people's daily activities, which often extend far beyond residential areas. Since the 2010s, emerging mobility data sources have enabled a new understanding of socio-spatial segregation by considering daily activities such as work, school, shopping, and leisure visits. From traditional surveys to GPS trajectories, diverse data sources reveal that daily mobility can result in spatial segregation levels that differ from those observed in residential segregation.

Unfortunately, although the widely employed antenna arrays in 5G remote radio units (RRUs) facilitate the measurement of the direction of arrival (DOA), DOA-based positioning performance is severely degraded by array errors. This paper proposes an in-situ calibration framework with a user terminal transmitting 5G reference signals at several known positions in the actual operating environment and the accessible RRUs estimating their array errors from these reference signals. Further, since sub-6GHz small-cell RRUs deployed for indoor coverage generally have small-aperture antenna arrays, while 5G signals have plentiful bandwidth resources, this work segregates the multipath components via super-resolution delay estimation based on the maximum likelihood criteria. This differs significantly from existing in-situ calibration works which resolve multipaths in the spatial domain. The superiority of the...",

We hypothesized that neurogenesis may be a neural plasticity mechanism involved in mating-induced pair bond formation. Here, we evaluated the differentiation potential of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of both female and male adult voles as a function of sociosexual experience. Animals were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) control (Co), sexually naive female and male voles that had no contact with another vole of the opposite sex; (2) social exposure (SE), males and females exposed to olfactory, auditory, and visual stimuli from a vole of the opposite sex, but without physical contact; and...",

The model accounted for the advantage of eyes-focused pattern in adults, and predicted that in children (partially trained models) consistency but not pattern of eye movements predicted recognition performance.

Behavioral risk factors are assumed to largely mediate these relationships, but few studies have examined this. We examined three neighborhood contextual factors that could exert direct effects on inflammation: (1) neighborhood socioeconomic status, (2) an index of concentration at extremes (that measures segregation), and (3) surrounding vegetation (greenness). METHODS: Using blood samples and addresses collected from prospective cohorts of 7,930 male (1990-1994) and 16,183 female (1986-1990) health professionals with at least one inflammatory marker, we prospectively linked neighborhood contextual factors to inflammatory biomarkers (adiponectin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-2). Log-transformed, z-scaled component measures were used to calculate an inflammation score. Neighborhood socioeconomic status and index of concentration of extremes were obtained from the 1990 decennial census and linked to participant addresses. Surrounding greenness was assessed from satellite data and focal statistics were applied...",

Results: Older adults living in compact neighborhoods with higher population and housing density, smaller land parcels, and more access to green space reported lower levels of loneliness. Compact and mixed land-use neighborhoods may increase people's exposure to and social interactions with surrounding people and the environment. Conclusion: The built environment provides the context for social interactions. Our study and findings inform research and suggest the development of interventions surrounding the built environment that could potentially help tackle loneliness in older adults.",

This study assessed the potential for reducing firearm violence disparities by increasing access to tree cover. Units of analysis were census tracts in six U.S. cities (Baltimore, MD; Philadelphia, PA; Richmond, VA; Syracuse, NY; Washington, DC; Wilmington, DE). We measured segregation using the index of concentration at the extremes (ICE) for race-income. We calculated proportion tree cover based on 2013-2014 imagery. Outcomes were 2015-2020 fatal and non-fatal shootings from the Gun Violence Archive. We modeled firearm violence as a function of ICE, tree cover, and covariates representing the social and built environment.

METHODS: We remotely visited locations of opioid-involved fatal overdoses provided by the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, 2017-2019 (n=3276), with Google Street View and used systematic social observation to assess characteristics of the street block related to drug exposures. We cross-referenced home address with city shelters and supportive housing to identify PEH (n=503). We used the differences of K functions from the spatial point patterns and kernel ratio function maps to identify geographic clusters. We then used logistic regression to identify significant individual-, block-, and neighborhood-level covariates (neighborhood deprivation, segregation, population density).

It has been difficult to assess this hypothesis because past approaches to measuring socioeconomic mixing have relied on static residential housing data rather than real-life exposures between people at work, in places of leisure, and in home neighborhoods. Here we develop a new measure of exposure segregation (ES) that captures the socioeconomic diversity of everyday encounters. Leveraging cell phone mobility data to represent 1.6 billion exposures among 9.6 million people in the United States, we measure exposure segregation across 382 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and 2829 counties. We discover that exposure segregation is 67% higher in the 10 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) than in small MSAs with fewer than 100,000 residents. This means that, contrary to expectation, residents of large cosmopolitan areas have significantly less exposure to diverse individuals. Second, we...",

The requirement of patients on dialysis for regular treatment in settings typically not conducive to social distancing may increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS: Over a 6-week period, we recorded new COVID-19 infections and outcomes for all adult patients receiving dialysis in a large dialysis center. Rapidly introduced control measures included a two-stage routine screening process at dialysis entry (temperature and symptom check, with possible cases segregated within the unit and tested for SARS-CoV-2), isolated dialysis in a separate unit for patients with infection, and universal precautions that included masks for dialysis nursing staff. RESULTS: Of 1530 patients (median age 66 years; 58.2% men) receiving dialysis, 300 (19.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, creating a large demand for isolated outpatient dialysis and inpatient beds. An analysis that included 1219 patients attending satellite dialysis clinics found...",

We will also propose an algorithm for clinical examination and treatment decisions and a pain model integrating current knowledge of pain neuroscience. The clinical examination of patients with TMDs should be based on nociceptive mechanisms and include the potential identification of the dominant, central, or peripheral sensitization driver. Additionally, the musculoskeletal drivers of these sensitization processes should be assessed with the aim of reproducing symptoms. Therapeutic strategies applied for managing TMDs can be grouped into tissue-based impairment treatments (bottom-up interventions) and strategies targeting the central nervous system (top-down interventions). Bottom-up strategies include joint-, soft tissue-, and nerve-targeting interventions, as well as needling therapies, whereas top-down strategies...",

Outdoor vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is such a task where an agent follows natural language instructions and navigates a real-life urban environment. Due to the lack of human-annotated instructions that illustrate intricate urban scenes, outdoor VLN remains a challenging task to solve. This paper introduces a Multimodal Text Style Transfer (MTST) learning approach and leverages external multimodal resources to mitigate data scarcity in outdoor navigation tasks. We first enrich the navigation data by transferring the style of the instructions generated by Google Maps API, then pre-train the navigator with the augmented external outdoor navigation dataset. Experimental results show that our MTST learning approach is model-agnostic, and our MTST approach significantly outperforms the baseline models on the outdoor VLN task, improving task completion rate by 8.7% relatively on the test set.",

Here we report on the previously unreported manifestation of urban complexity -- scaling in patterns of residential racial segregation. A high-resolution racial grid of a city is segmented into racial enclaves which are patches of stationary racial composition. Empirical PDFs of patch areas and population counts in 41 US cities were analyzed to reveal that these variables have distributions which are either power laws or approximate power laws. Power law holds for a pool of all patches, for patches from individual cities, and patches restricted to specific racial types. The average value of the exponent is 1.64/1.68 for area/population in 1990 and 1.70/1.74 in 2010. The values of exponents for type-specific patches vary, but variations had decreased from 1990 to 2010. We have also performed a...",

Crowd model outputs have been used for evaluating safety and comfort of pedestrians, inform crowd management and perform forensic investigations. Microscopic crowd models allow the representation of each person and the obtainment of information concerning their location over time and interactions with the physical space/other people. Pandemics such as COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of disease transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling can be used to assess occupant exposure in confined spaces. The policies adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a pandemic can vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the spread of disease rather than a safety assessment performed at a building level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant exposure in buildings based on...",

Among the factors contributing to these disparities is the physical environment in which individuals live. Neighborhood characteristics, ranging from air pollution exposure to residential segregation, have been found to be related to cardiovascular health (CVH) and stroke risk. Through the use of cross-sectional, longitudinal, and analytic regression modeling, we are gaining clarity about the relationship between an individual's external environment and CVH. Moreover, differences in CVH vary by sex and/or race within the same neighborhood. The mechanism by which these disparities exist is still being explored. In this review, we examine the literature that has accumulated regarding how external environments and community factors affect individuals and populations by race and sex.",

Their perimeter distribution $p(r)$ follows a power-law behavior beyond a critical threshold of the density of the built environment. In this regime, the species coexistence likelihood $p(d)$, where $d$ is the distance to the nearest competitor, which we define to be a building with a larger $r$, bifurcates with the buildings' number $n$.

This study explores the momentary association between minute-level global positioning systems (GPS)-based greenness exposure and time-matched objectively measured physical activity.Methods: Adult women were recruited from sites across the United States. Participants wore a GPS device and accelerometer on the hip for 7 days to assess location and physical activity at minute-level epochs.

A first behavior cue regards the human movement patterns, then for obtaining a better overview of what is happening inside an environment, context information is used. More information regarding behavior can be extracted, by analyzing the interaction patterns with objects in the environment. Finally, facial expressions, which can be used to assess a person's reaction to an object or in our case study to a product are employed as another informative behavior cue. Each intermediary analysis stream (trajectory analysis, action recognition, ROI detection module, and facial expression analysis), provides an input to the reasoning model, which based on the observables formulates a hypothesis regarding the most likely behavioral model. We integrated the different types of information on the semantic level, by implementing a multi-level framework. Finally, we evaluated this system...",

This initiative is intended to create a data-enabled research environment to rigorously study the complex interactions in urban neighborhoods. The QC has initially launched in three very distinct areas in New York City: at Hudson Yards, a ground-up \"city-within-a-city\" of approximately 20 million square feet in Manhattan, in collaboration with the Related Companies; in Lower Manhattan, a mixed-use neighborhood that attracts residents, workers, and visitors, in collaboration with the Alliance for Downtown NY; and in Red Hook, Brooklyn, an economically-distressed community facing significant development and demographic changes, in partnership with the Red Hook Initiative. This paper describes our recent pilot project to deploy novel urban sensors in...",

The neighborhood built environment has been extensively studied in relation to obesity noting an increased risk of development and prevalence of obesity in relation to numerous built environment characteristics (lack of green spaces, higher number of fast food restaurants, low walkability indices). The neighborhood social environment, however, has been less extensively studied but is perhaps an equally important component of the neighborhood environment. The neighborhood social environment, particularly constructs of social capital, collective efficacy, and crime, is associated with obesity among both adults and children. Several studies have identified physical activity as a potential pathway of the neighborhood social environment and obesity association. Further work on social networks and norms and residential segregation, as well as the examination of dietary behaviors and mental health as potential mediating...",

      "Abstract150w": "Many group-living animals actively defend a home range against neighboring groups. In many of these societies, males are the primary participants during group defense, while female participation ranges from seldom to frequent. Among howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.), loud calls (i.e., howling) are often used in the context of intergroup spacing as a form of cooperative group defense. Males initiate and lead these howling bouts, but females occasionally participate as well. During a 28-month study, I examined social and ecological factors influencing the participation of adult females in naturally occurring howling bouts of five multimale-multifemale groups of black howler monkeys (A. pigra) at Palenque National Park, Mexico. I calculated the percentage of time each female participated during howling bouts for which the participation of all resident females could be recorded >/=80% of the time (N = 287). At least one female was observed to participate in 53% of the vocal displays....",

      "Abstract150w": "In recent years, there has been increasing attention to the spatial dimensions of residential segregation, such as the spatial arrangement of segregated neighborhoods and the geographic scale or relative size of segregated areas. However, the methods used to measure segregation do not incorporate features of the built environment, such as the road connectivity between locations or the physical barriers that divide groups. This article introduces the Spatial Proximity and Connectivity (SPC) method for measuring and analyzing segregation. The SPC method addresses the limitations of current approaches by taking into account how the physical structure of the built environment affects the proximity and connectivity of locations. In this article, I describe the method and its application for studying segregation and spatial inequality more broadly. I demonstrate one such application-analyzing the impact of physical barriers on residential segregation-with a stylized example and an empirical analysis of racial segregation in Pittsburgh, PA.

We identify reliable indicators that separate Galactic/local from extragalactic sources and concentrate here on the objects in our Galaxy and its closest satellites. We develop colour and magnitude criteria that are based only on WISE data to select asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with circumstellar dust shells, and separate them into O-rich and C-rich classes. With these criteria we produce an all-sky map for the count ratio of the two populations. The map reveals differences between the Galactic disc, the Magellanic Clouds and the Sgr Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy, as well as a radial gradient in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disc. We find that the C:O number ratio for dusty AGB stars increases with distance from the LMC centre about twice as fast as measured for...",

Few studies have examined mediating pathways, in part because, with binary outcomes, indirect effects estimated from multiplicative models generally lack causal interpretation. We develop a method to estimate additive-scale natural direct and indirect effects from logistic regression. We then evaluate whether segregation operates through poor-quality built environment to affect preterm birth. METHODS: To estimate natural direct and indirect effects, we derive risk differences from logistic regression coefficients. Birth records (2000-2008) for Durham, North Carolina, were linked to neighborhood-level measures of racial isolation and a composite construct of poor-quality built environment. We decomposed the total effect of racial isolation on preterm birth into direct and indirect effects. RESULTS: The adjusted total effect of an interquartile increase in racial isolation on preterm birth was an extra 27 preterm events per 1000 births (risk difference = 0.027 [95% confidence interval = 0.007 to...",

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence strongly points to the ubiquitous influence of circadian timing in nearly all physiologic functions. Thus, in addition to the prominent sleep and wake disturbances, circadian rhythm disorders are associated with cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders. The recent availability of biomarkers of circadian timing in clinical practice has improved our ability to identify and treat these CRSDs. SUMMARY: Circadian rhythms are endogenous rhythms with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours. These rhythms are synchronized to the physical environment by social and work schedules by various photic and nonphotic stimuli. CRSDs result from a misalignment between the timing of the circadian rhythm and the external environment (eg, jet lag and shift work) or...",

This study assessed L. catta and P. verreauxi population densities across a 3-km dry forest gradient (1,539 ha) in southern Madagascar. The study was designed to allow lemur densities to be related to particular forest types. A particular aim of this study was to collect lemur data in both protected and unprotected areas. Density estimates were calculated using point transect distance sampling in a study area that contained the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve and the adjacent disturbed forests.

The alpha-satellite subfamilies from chromosomes 21 and 13 are almost identical in sequence and thus cannot be distinguished using conventional hybridization techniques. Analysis using nuclear families showed that the centromeric polymorphism, detected using our specific probe and pulsed-field gel restriction analysis, segregates in a Mendelian fashion and exhibits a high degree of polymorphism among unrelated individuals. The alphoid DNA of chromosome 21 is highly polymorphic, useful not only as a definitive anchor for the genetic map, but also for studies of chromosome 21 nondisjunction, including the unequivocal assignment of meiotic origin.",

New microsatellite markers developed from these YACs were genotyped on large, consanguineous LGMD2A pedigrees from different origins. The identification of recombination events in these families allowed the restriction of the LGMD2A region to an estimated 1-cM interval, equivalent to approximately 3-4 Mb.
