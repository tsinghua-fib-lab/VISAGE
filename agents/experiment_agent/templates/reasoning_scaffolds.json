      "concept": "Income Segregation",
      "definition": "Income segregation refers to the degree to which individuals with different income levels are spatially separated within a geographic area. One visible and consequential manifestation is socioeconomic segregation - the spatial and social separation of income groups that limits inter-class contact, entrenches mobility barriers, and distorts perceptions of inequality. Recent work has shifted attention to exposure segregation, the degree to which daily encounters cross income groups, moving beyond static, residence-based measures to the dynamics shaped by complex mobility patterns and heterogeneous urban form.",
      "measurement_approach": "Measured by analyzing the proportion of different income groups among visitors to each Census Tract and calculating the deviation from an equal distribution. This captures exposure segregation based on daily mobility patterns rather than residential segregation.",
      "key_distinction": "This analysis focuses on the income composition of people VISITING the Census Tract, not just those residing there, reflecting real-world exposure and interaction patterns."
